# abstract method
  -> does not have a body
  -> ends with a semicolon
  -> must be in the abstract class
  -> must be overridden

# abstract class
  -> no object can be created
  -> reference variable can be made
  -> can have abstract and non-abstract method

# interface
  -> by default all variables are "public static final"
  -> by default all functions are "public abstract"
  -> multiple inheritance can be possible
  -> interface can extend other interfaces but a class does 'implements' an interface
  -> no object can be created
